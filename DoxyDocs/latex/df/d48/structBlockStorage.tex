\-Stores data of one voxel block which is currently unloaded, including all objects which are in this block \-T\-O\-D\-O\-: block and objects could be separated for more performance; access has to be synchronized between volume load thread $<$-\/$>$ main thread for the blocks, but objects are only accessed by the main thread.
