If you work with Windows, open CMakeLists.txt and adjust the include paths below the line "ELSE(CMAKE_HOST_UNIX)" to your system.
Then use the CMake GUI to create the build files for MinGW.

If you work with Linux, create a folder named "build" in this directory, cd into it and run "cmake ../".
Then you can build the project as usual with make.
